# My Expo React Native App with Tailwind CSS

This project is a React Native app built with Expo that allows users to generate events and add participants. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and uses SWAPI (Star Wars API) with Apollo Client to fetch participant data. The app manages state using MobX state management library and is implemented with TypeScript for type safety.
